    <p>You are what you eat! What a saying! This is indeed true. What you put in your body is so important. But This is something that people do not realize.
        <strong> Your body is like a tree </strong>. If you nourish a tree with water, fertilizer, and compost, your tree will grow tall and produce flowers and fruits.
        The same way if you nourish your body with water, good nutrients and vitamins, your body will grow and flourish.</p>
    
    <p>Nevertheless, if you do not give a tree water at its roots and if you put trash in the soil, the tree will become dry and will start dying without reaching
        its full height potential. The same is true for the human body. If you eat a lot of junk food, i.e chips, fast food, candy, soda, oily food and processed food, your body will
        become malnourished. You will start developing diseases that destroy your body and you will start dying way before reaching your golden years. </p>
    
    <p>But here is the good news! If you change your eating habits now, your body will thank you for that. Not only will you feel better, but you will get less and less sick
      and you will pass your 70s with ease. </p>
